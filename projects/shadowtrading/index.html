                  ShadowTrading is embarking on an innovative ambition: to transform the strategies of experienced traders into algorithms that can be executed by trading robots. This initiative aims to automate trading by replicating the winning tactics of professionals, making trading successes accessible to a wider audience through technology.

                  The ShadowTrading project is based on the <span class="thirdary-color">MQL5</span> language and the <span class="thirdary-color">MetaTrader 5</span> platform, which are essential for coding and deploying our advanced trading algorithms. In addition, we have developed a <span class="thirdary-color">REST API in Python</span> to orchestrate communication between robots and user interfaces, ensuring smooth and efficient integration. Optimization is at the heart of our process, exploiting MetaTrader 5's <span class="thirdary-color">genetic algorithms</span> to fine-tune robot performance. Each robot is containerized, enabling massive deployment on our optimized servers to maximize efficiency while minimizing resource requirements.
