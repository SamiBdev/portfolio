                    At Bricklayerland, I was responsible for overseeing and executing the game's development as co-founder. I was involved in both the conceptual and technical aspects of the game, devoting myself entirely to its creation. My work covered all aspects of game development, from programming interactive elements to integrating blockchain functionalities
                    <br><br>
                    I personally took charge of the game's development. For the blockchain components, in particular the smart contracts on Binance Smart Chain (BSC), I collaborated with another developer skilled in Solidity, balancing my overall approach to game development with specialist expertise where necessary.
                    <br><br>
                    While I focused on the technological and developmental aspects of Bricklayerland, my co-founder concentrated on the project's financial and marketing strategies. His role was crucial in defining our approach to tokenomics and community engagement, drawing on his substantial experience in the web3 domain.
                    <br><br>
                    Our team consisted of <span class="thirdary-color">five people</span>, including developers, sales people and graphic designers. My role extended beyond development to include team management, working alongside my co-founder to ensure that our collective efforts were aligned with the project's vision and goals. This collaboration was essential to navigating the challenges and milestones of creating Bricklayerland.
