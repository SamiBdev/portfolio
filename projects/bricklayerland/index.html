                    <p class="text-top-project">Bricklayerland is a BNB blockchain-based Play-to-Earn game where players, as construction contractors, build and develop properties to generate income. They use the game's currency, BRK, to erect structures, from small apartments to large houses, with defined construction times. The game incorporates NFTs to increase efficiency and earnings, bringing a collecting aspect and bonuses. Bricklayerland combines strategic gaming and the digital economy, offering a fun experience that can be monetized on blockchain.</p>

            <h3 class="title-card mt-mb">Technologies Used</h3>
            <div>
                <p class="pr-p-text">
                    In the development of Bricklayerland, a diverse technology stack was employed to create a robust and responsive gaming experience. The website's backend was engineered using <span class="thirdary-color">PHP</span> in conjunction with the <span class="thirdary-color">Symfony</span> framework, ensuring a strong, scalable foundation for web operations. The frontend was crafted with the classic trio of web development: <span class="thirdary-color">JavaScript</span>, <span class="thirdary-color">HTML</span>, and <span class="thirdary-color">CSS</span>, creating a seamless and interactive user interface.
                    <br><br>
                    For the game's interactive elements, full <span class="thirdary-color">JavaScript</span> was utilized alongside <span class="thirdary-color">PixiJS</span>, a powerful 2D rendering engine that brought the game's graphics to life. The integration with the blockchain was achieved through <span class="thirdary-color">Web3.js</span>, which facilitated a secure and efficient connection to the Binance Smart Chain for in-game transactions and interactions.
                    <br><br>
                    The smart contracts that governed the game's logic on the blockchain were written in <span class="thirdary-color">Solidity</span>, a contract-oriented programming language, ensuring transparent and reliable gameplay mechanics.
                    <br>The deployed smart contract at the heart of Bricklayerland governs in-game economics, player interactions, and the distribution of rewards, encapsulating the play-to-earn model in its purest form. The contract's address on BSC is a testament to its transparency and immutability, providing players with verifiable assurance of the game's fairness and the developers' accountability.
                    <br>For those interested in exploring the technicalities or verifying the integrity of the game mechanics, the smart contract can be found at the following BSC address: <a href="https://bscscan.com/address/0xbe3d00692c7d2dd2c221fba53126cd7c018b0c9b#code">0xbe3d00692c7d2dd2c221fba53126cd7c018b0c9b</a>. This open access underlines our commitment to a trustless gaming ecosystem where players can engage with full confidence in the system's integrity and longevity.
                    <br><br>
                    Additionally, a separate <span class="thirdary-color">NodeJS</span> server was implemented to handle the secure distribution of tokens from the liquidity pool to players. This was necessary for security reasons and to perform backend tasks that could not be executed on the client side, such as processing claims for player earnings, which required access to the liquidity pool's wallet.
                    <br><br>
                    Finally, the entire infrastructure was deployed on a <span class="thirdary-color">Linux</span> (Ubuntu Server) environment, with <span class="thirdary-color">Docker</span> containers orchestrating the various services. This setup provided a stable, isolated, and efficient deployment methodology, which was crucial for maintaining the game's performance and scalability.

            <h3 class="title-card mt-mb">Results and Impact</h3>
            <div>
                <p class="pr-p-text">
                    Bricklayerland achieved a remarkable global reach, successfully attracting over <span class="thirdary-color">10,000 players</span> from diverse regions, including France, Germany, Brazil, the Philippines, and Morocco. This international community reflects the universal appeal and accessibility of the game.
                    <br><br>
                    The project's financial milestones were equally impressive, with an Initial Coin Offering (ICO) that raised <span class="thirdary-color">$40,000</span>, demonstrating significant investor confidence and market potential. Following the ICO, Bricklayerland experienced several months of sustained success, with high engagement levels and consistent player activity that underscored the game's popularity and the robustness of its economic model.
                    <br><br>
                    However, the volatile nature of the cryptocurrency market posed challenges that were felt in 2022 when the crypto market experienced a significant downturn. The liquidity pool, crucial for the game's play-to-earn feature, could not withstand the market's instability. Despite the game's strong performance and community support, this economic strain led to the difficult decision to cease operations.
                    <br><br>
                    The impact of Bricklayerland extends beyond its operational period; it serves as a case study in the play-to-earn space, highlighting both the potential and the risks associated with building games on the blockchain. The experience garnered from this project is invaluable, contributing to a deeper understanding of the interplay between gaming, finance, and decentralized technology.

            <h3 class="title-card mt-mb">My Role</h3>
            <div>
                <p class="pr-p-text">
                    At Bricklayerland, I was responsible for overseeing and executing the game's development as co-founder. I was involved in both the conceptual and technical aspects of the game, devoting myself entirely to its creation. My work covered all aspects of game development, from programming interactive elements to integrating blockchain functionalities
                    <br><br>
                    I personally took charge of the game's development. For the blockchain components, in particular the smart contracts on Binance Smart Chain (BSC), I collaborated with another developer skilled in Solidity, balancing my overall approach to game development with specialist expertise where necessary.
                    <br><br>
                    While I focused on the technological and developmental aspects of Bricklayerland, my co-founder concentrated on the project's financial and marketing strategies. His role was crucial in defining our approach to tokenomics and community engagement, drawing on his substantial experience in the web3 domain.
                    <br><br>
                    Our team consisted of <span class="thirdary-color">five people</span>, including developers, sales people and graphic designers. My role extended beyond development to include team management, working alongside my co-founder to ensure that our collective efforts were aligned with the project's vision and goals. This collaboration was essential to navigating the challenges and milestones of creating Bricklayerland.
